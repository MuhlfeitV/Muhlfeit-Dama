## Features

### Play with or without friends
CheckersVM is ideal for sitting down and playing a game with your friends but if you've got no-one to play with, navigate to the settings menu and play against a bot! Or, if you don't feel like playing at all, you can grab some popcorn and place a bet as you watch two bots play against each other!

### Customisability
CheckersVM allows you to customise your gameplay experience by letting you choose from three different sets of colours for your game!
